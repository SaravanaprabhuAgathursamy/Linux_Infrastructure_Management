# Problem Management

This is chapter which will make you aware of how problem related to infrastructure can be handled and mitigate in efficent way.

 I am a kind of person, who don't believe in stories but believe in what is actually happening/happend thing.And strongly believe living with a bunch of people all the time that they give more "black and white" picture then distorted thing with some colorful stories.It saves my time and their too.

 So, in broader sense,problem comes in bunch and go away with bunch..yep general rule of life.But,in BU,problem can be catagorised in different form..i.e genuine problem,created problem,arse saving problem,incompetency guard problem et al.Frankly I am not at all interested on others but the first one.Unfortunately you have to deal with others,wheather you like it or not and need to take some really really drastic steps to eliminate other kinds of "cosmetic" problem from your life and foucs on main problem.

 Now for instance,as I have had into the BU's infra for some organisation ,so I can vouch,emergency can come onece in a month or bimonthly...and you can deal with it.But if it's started to come frequently then those interval,then two thing come to your mind.One,the infrastructure needs serious kind of look up in quick time but regorious.Second,need to evaluate the guys are operating or managing on it. No other go I believe,you just can not sit on it for long.It might explode on some undesireable time and make look fool.So,long story short,proactiveness is hightly desireable.We generally are good on reactiveness.
