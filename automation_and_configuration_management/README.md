# Automation and Configuration Management
This is kinda core of part infrastructure management in any form.Sooner or later time will come ,when you wanted few thing  to be get done autometically,without much supervision.Specially when the infrastructure is growing and complexity arise.We basically want to eliminate things which are redudent to operate.Because we need to concentrate on more volatile thing within the infra more closely.

I know cron job do fine and most of the time is sufficient enough to get thing done,but beyond certain point ,we need to consider how to enhance and get thing done in proper manner.Writing tools to do the job done was the norm in open system management ,because it will allow you to do so,a rich set of inbuilt tools are come along with it.I wrote and still do write whenever I got chance to enahance.But having said that,the modern SCM(Software Configuration Managers) are quite smart(and I haven't had hands on thing with cfengine..heck),everything else is modern ,even chef.I have had done few things with puppet and salt .Like both of them .Both has pros and cons,like other softwares.And mind you,it does require some steep learning curve,but it will be all worth,if you spend enough time to get the gory details of it or how it works internally.Most of the shops,even the cloud based projects are heavily  lean on it,because they understand the importance and flexibility  it brings into the table.You can attend and achieve so many thing with minimal fuss and rigor.While you need to be cautious at times,to monitor it that it is doing the right job,what was intended.CI (Jenkin) can be your friend.

Puppet is written in ruby and very flexible,purely using OOPS concepts inside it.The noticible downside would be slow nature of work/processing.On the other hand,Saltstack is written in python,and quite flexible and extensible too.And performance wise it will probably beat puppet.That is python's ability to interpret quickly.Anyway,you can choose whatever is your cup of tea,or the best bet for the perticular environment.Now ,a little catch,I should warn,you need to be very conversant with those or have personnel at your disposal to do the job and troubleshooting if something goes wrong(sometime it will certainly).So,you been exposed to the system or the personnel exposed to those system have to have much more insight to get things back in track.

I would propose ,designate only those personnel involve in it,those who have inclination towards it,but not to someone who wanted thing done by it.As I said erlier it needs little bit steep learning curve and understanding of internals too.Not everybody has that kind of inclination towads it.You need to identify the resouce from your team,or budget permit hire only those who are deep into it.
