# Problem Management
This is chapter which will make you aware of how problem related to infrastructure can be handled and mitigate in efficent way.

I am a kind of person, who don't believe in stories but believe in what is actually happening/happend thing.And strongly believe living with a bunch of people all the time that they give more "black and white" picture then distorted thing with some colorful stories.It saves my time and theor too.

So, in broader sense,problem comes in bunch and go away with bunch..yep general rule of life.But,in BU,problem can be catagorised in different form..i.e genuine problem,created problem,arse saving problem,incompetency guard problem et all.Frankly I am not at all interested on others but the first one.Unfortunately you have to deal with others,wheather you like it or not and need to take some really really drastic steps to eliminate other kinds of "cosmetic" problem from your life and foucs on main problem.

Now for instance,as I have had into the BU's infra for some organisation ,so I can vouch,emergency can come onece in a month or bimonthly...and you can deal with it.But if it's started to come frequently then those interval,then two thing come to your mind.One,the infrastructure needs serious kind of look up in quick but regorious.Second,need to evaluate the guys are operating or managing on it. No other go I believe,you just can not sit on it for long.It might explode on some undesireable time and make look fool.So,long story short,proactiveness is hightly desireable.We generally are good on reactiveness.

Now,when you manage a team,you need to split up things as important and urgent,everybody do..nothing special.I would prefer to do the urgent or assign someone in the team ,who can I believe accomplish whithout much fuss. And other important things has to be shared among the team members with proper eta. Sounds familiar?? bound to be ..this is way most of places operate.Plus on top of that I would to like someone from the team to dedicatedly involve in documentation process i.e building SOPs for future endeavour.Being in charge of a team of any size you need to figure out who is best at what .And on that basis you can assign jobs.It is pretty easy to figure it out.By means,I need to convey distribution of the ownership between the members.

So,basically I make people accountable for what they are doing and also make sure that they get due credit for that.It will certainly boast the morale in turn bring more productivity and sense of responsibility.When you bestowed with that kind of honor,chances will be high to gain more then to loose.Managing EGO ,with a experiance team is a huge deal,and most of your success relies on that.What fatal thing we human have to demean and degrade ourselve.
