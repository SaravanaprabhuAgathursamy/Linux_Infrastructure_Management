# Solution Delivary
Well we have look into the problem and how to tackle them,but providing solution to the external and as well internal stakeholders needs different set of jobs.And ultimately that counts a lot about teams performance measured by some "Black Suit" wearing fellow sitting on top.

But from technical stand point of view,we have to make sure everything in place to make the solution will be sustained one.And we might use it in the future(as I mentioned the importance of Wiki et al in chapter 3 information management).We need to organise every solution like it should look like a KB in place.It will save time and headache later  to do something useful later.Certainly help to automate things and make an enhancement lot easier.

So,diffent enterprise approach to the problem solving different way and few of them stand out.The solution should consists of a link to the wiki or whatever or wherever we post the steps and outcome of that perticular problem.Say,the infrastructure having a perenneial problem with httpd and it has been solve with some monumental efforts. That efforts should not go waste ,and should be in a proper format to concerned persons(the black suit wearing ) jerk! I have had habit of almost every thing copied from the terminal(yeah I know better method of doing thing )and at least paste on gedit or some other note taking place..if not another vim .So,later I can sort and filter out the absolutely necessary information out of it( processing of raw data) and put it into wiki or document space.

Solutions should absolutely clear and precise.Having said that I meant,it should have step by step approch whenever prossible.If and only if require should go into the details explaining the cause in small vignette.Yes,you got it right ,need to write clear SOP for all the problem we faced and solved.Those SOP's get exchnaged with guy up in the verticals.But do those guys care about it ?? NOO, they don't .They only care about the matix,and they need that to asses the delivery(oh no!),yep that's the way.
